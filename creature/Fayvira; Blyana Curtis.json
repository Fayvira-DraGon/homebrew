A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.",

It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.",

Dire lycanthrope are more resistant to magic and silver than their normal counter-parts, their hides are thicker, their bodies tougher, and their cursed attacks naturally carry the properties of magic and silvered weapons.
