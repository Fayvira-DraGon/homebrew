					"Etched with druidic runes, this 2-inch-diameter uncut emerald causes any armor or barding you wear to adjust to fit any form and size you take, preventing it from melding into your new form. If your new form cannot wear armor or barding, the armor or barding melds into your new form. All properties of armor or barding that can be worn are carry over into the new form. For this property to work, you must attach the emerald to your body by pressing the emerald against your skin for at least 10 minutes. Thereafter, the emerald can't be removed unless you detach it as an action or the emerald is severed from your main body. Not even an {@spell antimagic field} causes it to fall off. The emerald does fall off if your attunement to it ends. Armor or barding returns to its original size and shape when removed from you, when you revert to your true form, or when your attunement to it ends."
